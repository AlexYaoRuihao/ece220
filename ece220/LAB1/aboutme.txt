NetID QGAO10

I'm a sophomore and currently taking ECE 210 220 313 and 314 this semester. I'm major in EE but through studying ECE120 last year I realized I developed great passion in coding stuff.In this course I hope I could boarder my horizon on C language and have a deeper understanding about computer system.
